# Stitch
Stitch is a set of tools for working with and updating mappings in the `.tiny` format.

Over the last few years, large parts of its functionality have been made redundant by other tools though, and nowadays, it's mostly only used for [intermediary generation and updating](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:updating_yarn).

Preferable alternatives:
- [Mapping IO](https://github.com/FabricMC/mapping-io) for reading/writing/converting mappings
- [Name Proposal](https://github.com/FabricMC/name-proposal) for proposing names in Enigma
