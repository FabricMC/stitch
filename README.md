# Stitch
Stitch is a set of tools for working with and updating mappings in the `.tiny` format.

Large parts of its functionality have been replaced by other tools though, and nowadays, it's mostly only used for [intermediary generation and updating](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:updating_yarn).
